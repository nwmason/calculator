# A "Simple" Calculator

Looking back on this project and my initial approach, saying I was in over my head is an understatement. Setting up the initial calculator went without a hitch, issues arose when I began figuring out how to calculate the entered equations.

I was insistant at the beginning that I would allow longer, multi-operation equations that would all seamlessly calculate from a string without use of eval() or other, equally not good solutions. This project was at a standstill until I realized I simply do not have the knowledge to accomplish this yet and settled for the current iteration.

This calculator supports decimals and percentages. The screen will autoclear when you begin entering a new number after calculation, and will use your resulting number if you enter an operation as well. A small selection of error messages are available for improper actions.
